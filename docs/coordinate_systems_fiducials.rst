(ADVANCED) 3D Coordinate Systems
==================================


------------------------


Limelight Camera Space
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

------------------------

3d Cartesian Coordinate System with (0,0,0) at the camera lens.

X+ → Pointing to the right (if you were to embody the camera)

Y+ → Pointing downward

Z+ → Pointing out of the camera

------------------------


Target Space
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

------------------------

3d Cartesian Coordinate System with (0,0,0) at the center of the target.

X+ → Pointing to the right of the target (If you are looking at the target)

Y+ → Pointing downward

Z+ → Pointing out of the target (orthogonal to target's plane).

------------------------


Robot Space
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

------------------------

3d Cartesian Coordinate System with (0,0,0) located at the center of the robot’s frame projected down to the floor.

X+ → Pointing forward (Forward Vector)

Y+ → Pointing toward the robot’s right (Right Vector)

Z+ → Pointing upward (Up Vector)

------------------------

Field Space
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

------------------------

3d Cartesian Coordinate System with (0,0,0) located at the center of the field

X+ → Points along the long side of the field

Y+ → Points up the short side of the field

Z+ → Points towards the sky

Right-handed. Positive theta results in counterclockwise rotation from positive outside perspective
